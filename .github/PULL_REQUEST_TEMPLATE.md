Welcome to the xi-editor project! We're very excited for your contribution to become a part of the editor.
This template provides some basic instructions on how to format a pull request, so we can more easily understand it.
Anything within this commented block will not be a part of the visible text.

The first part of your pull request should be a summary describing its intent. This is also an appropriate place to explain the motivation behind the changes it introduces.
--->
## Summary
Example: `Add a pull request template. This will make it easier for newcomers to contribute to the project with confidence.`



<!---
Give reviewers and interested parties a good idea of how this is related to other issues or pull requests.
--->
## Related Issues
Example: `Related to #1`

<!---
GitHub has built-in functionality for closing issues when PR's are merged. TLDR: `closes #1` closes issue number 1 when the PR merges.
See [closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) for more info.
--->
Example: `closes #2`

<!---
Checklists are a useful tool for tracking your progress with longer pull requests. It gives reviewers a clear idea of how far you've come, and what can be reviewed. It's also fun to check off those boxes!
