Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at the end).

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the [Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1) (CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use Github pull requests for this purpose.

After a demonstrated record of contribution and understanding of the code base, we grant collaborator access, at our discretion. Collaborators have write access, subject to the following rules:

* Managing issues and merging trivial PR's (comments, doc fixes, etc) are fine.
* A Google-employed project member should approve all nontrivial PR's by non-Googlers.
* We wait for CI to be green, unless there is a really compelling reason.
* If the PR author has commit privs, then they should merge after approval (this
  gives the author a chance to make last-minute fixes). Otherwise, the approver
  generally merges.

### Code of conduct
We are committed to preserving and fostering a diverse, welcoming community. This project follows the [Fuchsia Code of Conduct](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/docs/+/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than the one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement.
