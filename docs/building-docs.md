## Development

You can run the site locally on your computer while making changes.

### Setup Ruby and Bundler

Ensure that you have Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed.

```
gem install bundler
```

### One-time setup

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

_Note: If you're on macOS and this fails installing nokogiri, run `brew unlink xz`, install, and then `brew link xz`._

### Running the site

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
